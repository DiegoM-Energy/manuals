## Line-in

It is also possible to enjoy your *Energy Bluetooth Music Box BZ1* without pairing it with a bluetooth device thanks to its line-ie connection (9) in which you can connect an audio cable with a 3.5mm jack connector and the other end to your player. 

To have turned on your *Energy Bluetooth Music Box BZ1* is a need in order to use this function.

**NOTE:** While using the device in "line in" mode, it is not possible to control the reproduction neither the volume from the speaker. You have to do it from your connected player.
