## Firmware reinstallation.

Your *MP3 Energy* has an installed operating system, usually called firmware, which sometimes needs to be reinstalled. The process is
easy, but has to be performed carefully, and only when it is really necessary.

If you see that the player halts, reboots randomly, or you have problems to access the memory content from your computer, then try pressing the RESET button with a needle or clip. If the problem persists then the firmware might be damaged and you should reinstall the latest version available.

To reinstall the firmware, access manually from a web browser to **www.energysistem.com.** Select your model at the products section and download the latest version available from the download zone. Uncompress the file in your computer and follow the included instructions in PDF format.
