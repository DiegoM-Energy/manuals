## FM Radio

Your MP3 Energy features an FM tuner with 20 station presets and the possibility of direct recording. If you want to listen to the radio while being at the main menu, select the RADIO option. The player will tune in the same station you where listening to the last time.

With the PREVIOUS / NEXT buttons you can scroll through the dialâ€™s frequency range. Simple keystrokes allow you to go back / forward, but if you keep the buttons pressed the device will enter auto-search mode. Also, when positioning the dial on one of the station presets, the device will display its number on the screen.

Press the PLAY button and you will be able to browse the station presets you have stored in memory. Press VOLUME +/- to raise or lower the volume.

Press the MENU button on the FM dial window to access the submenu options. Scroll through the different options using the NEXT / PREVIOUS buttons and press PLAY to select one:

1. Auto: Scans through different frequency ranges and saves the first 20 stations.

2. Save: Allows you to save the station you are listening to. If all 20 station presets are occupied, the last one will overwrite automatically.

3. Delete: Select this option to delete station presets.

To exit the submenu, press and hold the MENU button.

You can also record FM radio broadcasts in WAV audio files. To do this press the PLAY button to start recording from main menu of radio mode. You can pause and resume the recording by pressing the PLAY button. To finish recording, press and hold the MENU button. Press and hold the MENU button again if you want to exit the FM recording function and to return to the dial screen. All recordings are stored in the "Recordings" section of the MUSIC menu.
