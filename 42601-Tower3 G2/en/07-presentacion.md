## General overview

The *Energy Tower 3 g2* is a tower system that enables users to play music using Bluetooth technology, external memories (USB or microSD cards), Line-In and RCA inputs as well as FM radio. 

You will be able to pair it with tablets, smartphones, laptops, MAC, PC and any other Bluetooth device easily.

### Switching on and off the device. Stand-by mode

Once the Energy Tower 3 g2 has been plugged into a socket, move the power switch on the back side of the tower to the "ON" position. At that moment, you will be able to switch it on and off using the remote control or keeping the 'Play - Pause (5)' button on the top panel pressed for 2 seconds.

If you are not going to use the tower for a long period of time, we recommend, not only to switch it off from the top panel but also to turn the power switch to the "OFF" position.
### General functions

In order to select different functions, press 'Change mode (4)'. You will be able to see the selected function on the front LED screen. If you are not using the rear 'USB' 'MicroSD' 'AUX1' or 'AUX2' inputs, the 'Change mode (4)' button will change between FM Radio, Bluetooth, RCA (AUX1) or Line-IN (AUX2).

In case that you connect a device to any of these inputs, the *Energy Tower 3 g2* will change automatically to that function. If one or all inputs are being used, the 'Change mode (4)' button will change between all the available functions.

### Screen
