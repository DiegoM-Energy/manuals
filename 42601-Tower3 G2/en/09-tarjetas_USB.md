## SD and USB playback

In order to play MP3 files, insert a microSD card or an external USB unit in the corresponding slots, (10) and (11) respectively.

At this point, the *Energy Tower 3 g2* will automatically play the contents from the inserted external memory.

Depending on the type of memory you are using, the words "USB" or "SD" will appear on screen.

If you turn off your *Energy Tower 3 g2* or remove any external memory, the built-in memory will save the moment when you paused playback.

When you insert again the same external memory, playback will resume at the same moment you paused it.

To move to the previous or the following song, press the 'Next (7)' and 'Back (6)' buttons. Press the 'Change mode (4)' button to browse through folders.

## Playback mode

Keep the 'Change mode (4)' button pressed for 2 seconds or press the 'RPT' button on your remote control to select between these 3 options:

1) **ALL:** All contents of your external memories will be repeated. 

The folders of your external memories will be read in chronological order and the songs included in your folders will be read in alphabetical order.

For example: if you copy two music folders to an external memory, namely "A" and "B", and you first copy folder "B" and then folder "A", your device will play the first song in alphabetical order contained in folder "B" in the first place.
   Here you have a diagram of the reading order:

2) **ONE:**  The song you are listening to will be repeated.

3) **RAND:** Random playback of all the contents of your external memory.
