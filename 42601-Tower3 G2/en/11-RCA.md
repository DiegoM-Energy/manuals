## RCA Audio-In (AUX 1)

Your *Energy Tower 3 g2* features a 'RCA Audio-In (AUX) (8)' which allows you to connect your music player using a RCA audio cable.

This audio-in is situated in the top panel, with the name "Aux 1". It is a RCA stereo input. This input has been conceived to connect your TV or music system permanently. You will be able to enable and disable the use of this input through the 'Change mode (4)' button.

To use this function, connect the RCA cable end (L and R) to the stereo audio-in '(8)' (L and R respectively) and the 3.5 mm jack cable end to the audio-out of the device you want to use (MP3, laptop, smartphone, etc). 

Press 'Change mode (4)' and select "Aux 1" mode while your *Energy Tower 3 g2* is on. You will see "AUX1" on the LED screen '(1)' of the top panel.

When the "Aux1" playback mode is enabled, your Energy Tower 3 g2 is in speaker mode. This means that the content played by your audio device (external player) as well as all volume, equalizer or track changes will be heard through the Energy Tower 3 g2.

To start, pause or resume playback use the 'Play - Pause (5)' button.

Keep in mind that you will not be able to change the song with the 'Next (7)â€™ and 'Back (6)' buttons while the auxiliary audio-in is in use. Instead, you must do it through the audio device (external player) connected.
