## 3.5 mm Audio-In (AUX1)

Your *Energy Tower 3 g2* features a '3.5 mm Audio-In (AUX) (9)' which allows you to connect your music player using a 3.5 mm jack audio cable.

To use the "Line-In" function, connect one end of the provided audio cable to the '3.5 mm Audio-In (9)' and the other end to the device audio-out (Mp3 player, laptop, smartphone, etc.). Once you connect the cable to the '3.5 mm Audio-In (9)', the "Line-in" mode will be automatically enabled and "AUX2" will be displayed on the screen.

When the "Line-in" playback mode is enabled, your *Energy Tower 3 g2* is in speaker mode. This means that the content played by your audio device (external player) as well as volume, equalizer or track changes will be heard through the *Energy Tower 3 g2*.

To start, pause or resume playback use the 'Play - Pause (5)' button.

Keep in mind that you will not be able to change the song with the 'Next (7)' and 'Back (6)' buttons while the auxiliary audio-in is in use. Instead, you must do it through the audio device (external player) connected.
