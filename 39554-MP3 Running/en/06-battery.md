## BATTERY
Your MP3 Energy has an integrated rechargeable Li-Ion battery. It comes fully charged
from factory, but it is recommended to perform a full recharge before the first use. Recharge
the battery connecting the player to a computer using the bundled USB 2.0 cable.
Charging time is between 2 and 3 hours, depending if the player is powered off or working.
To keep the battery in good conditions, we recommend not using the player while charging
and not leaving it charging for more than 8 hours. In order to maximize the batteryâ€™s lifespan,
it is adviced to not disable completely these power saving features.
