## Connecting to a PC

To enjoy your favorite music on your MP3 Energy, first you must copy the files from your PC to device.

To do so, connect the MP3 player to the computer’s USB port. (Your PC will detect automatically your device without installing any driver).

Once this is done, you will be able to read / write onto the device’s memory as if it were a regular disk drive.
After transferring all data disconnect the MP3 player from the computer.

IMPORTANT: In order to prevent data loss, remember to perform a safe USB extraction before disconnecting the MP3 player.

## Firmware Update.

Your MP3 Energy has an operating system, commonly known as firmware, which sometimes needs to be reinstalled.

If the MP3 player crashes, restarts, or you have problems accessing the memory’s content from your computer, try pressing the RESET button using a small pin or needle. If you are not able to resolve these problems you will have to reinstall the operating system.

To reinstall manually the firmware go to ** www.energysistem.com / en / support **. Select your model in the product section and download the correct firmware version from the download area.

Unzip the file on your computer and follow the
instructions.
