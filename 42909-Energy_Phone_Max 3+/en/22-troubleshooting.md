## MicroSD/USB

Your Energy Phone Max 3+ has a slot for microSD cards to expand your device memory. Turn off your device before inserting/extracting the card in order to avoid accidental data loss.  It supports High Capacity \(microSD-HC\) and Extended Capacity \(microSD-XC\) card formats.

You will be able to set up your microSD card as removable storage or internal storage. If you set it up as removable storage, you will be able to store multimedia content on your microSD card. On the other hand, if you set up the card as internal storage, it will expand the device internal memory. You will not only be able to store multimedia content on the microSD card but also apps. In order to select this option, click on the notification that will pop up when inserting the SD card or go to Settings > Storage > Removable storage (or name of microSD card) > Settings > Storage settings.
