## Bluetooth setup

Your Energy Phone Max 3+ features Bluetooth 4.1 to connect your device to headphones, computers, tablets or any device that supports such communication protocol. You just need to go to Settings > Bluetooth and turn the switch ON. Then, the device will start a search of all available devices and once it has finished, you will only have to select one of them to establish the connection.
