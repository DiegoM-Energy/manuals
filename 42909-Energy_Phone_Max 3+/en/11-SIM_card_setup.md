## SIM card settings

Your Energy Phone Pro 3 offers the possibility of using a two nanoSIM cards at the same time or a nanoSIM card and a microSD card. In Settings > SIM Management, you can manage the use of both cards.

In this section you can set the default card to make or receive calls and send or receive text messages and set the data connection.

To place the nanoSIM/ microSD cards you should remove the card tray (see number1 in General overview section) using the tool (see number 19 in General overview section) located on the external part of the envelope that comes with the product. Insert the tool into the card tray hole (see number 1 in General overview section). Once removed, you will see that there are two possible combinations to use SIM and SD storage cards:

Option A: NanoSIM card 1 + microSD storage card. 
Option B: NanoSIM card 1 + nanoSIM card 2.
