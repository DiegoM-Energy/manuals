## Safety precautions and SAR
### Safety precautions
It is prohibited to use the phone in certain places such as airplanes, hospitals and service stations.
To reduce the amount of radiation use a hands-free kit, enable speaker mode, use a Bluetooth headset and do not make calls in places where the signal is weak (in the car, train or subway). Keep the phone away from sensitive areas like the belly of pregnant women, especially when making a phone call.  If you have an electronic implant (pacemakers, insulin pumps, neurostimulators...)  place the phone at least 15 cm away from the body and on the opposite side to the implant when making a phone call.
Do not expose your Energy Phone Max 3+ to temperatures or humidity outside the recommended range.
* Operating temperature:  -20 to 45 degrees.
* Operating humidity: 65+/-20% RH

The power socket that you intend to use to charge the device battery should be easily accesible. You must place the device close to it.

### Exposure information (SAR)
This device complies with the guidelines developed by the ICNIRP for exposure to radio waves. The unit does not exceed the SAR radio wave exposure limits.  This unit measures the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed by the body when using a device. The SAR limit adopted by Europe is 2.0 W/kg averaged over 10 grams of tissue. The test performed showed that the highest SAR value for this device when using it near the ear/head is 0.72 W/Kg.
