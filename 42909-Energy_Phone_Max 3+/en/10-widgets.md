In order to add a Widget to one of your desktops, tap the centre of the desktop (1) and then, select "WIDGETS" at the bottom of the screen (2). You can slide your finger to the right (3) to see all installed Widgets. Select the one you want to add to your desktop by keeping it pressed and then release it on the desktop.

Widgets can be easily removed or relocated to other screen areas. To relocate a widget, select it by pressing it for a few seconds. Once the app has been highlighted, you can move it to another desktop position.

To remove the widget, keep it pressed for a few seconds without releasing it until the corresponding icon appears on top of the screen. Then, drag the widget to that icon and release it.
