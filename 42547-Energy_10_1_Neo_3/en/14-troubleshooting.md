## Troubleshooting

1.	Why is not possible to play some MP3 files?
The MP3 file must follow the Layer 3 Standard for MPEG-1, MPEG-2 or MPEG 2.5 formats. Otherwise, they have to be converted using specific software.

2.	My Energy Tablet does not start, what can I do?
Make sure that the battery has enough charge when trying to turn it on. If the problem continues after charging the device for at least 30 minutes, there may be a problem with the installed operating system. Please refer to the "Updates" section of this manual.

3.	Why is not possible to play some WMA files?
Make sure you are not trying to play DRM-protected WMA files.

4.	Why is not possible to play video files, display images or text while using the music player?
In general, applications only display the files that are compatible and that the programme is able to read. Therefore, you will only be able to display the files with the format that is compatible with that programme while you browse the folders from that specific application. In order to see all files stored on the internal memory at the same time, run the file explorer application from the application menu.

5.	Why is not possible to display my jpg images?
Many digital cameras and image editing software add hidden data to jpg files. This can prevent your Energy Tablet from loading the images. Try deleting them by saving the images with other name.

6.	Sometimes the screen turns black and the device does not respond.
Keep the power button pressed for a few seconds to reboot your Energy Tablet.

7.	The built-in memory of the Energy Tablet is lower than specified. Why?
The Android operative system and the preinstalled apps of your device need approximately 1.5 GB of internal storage capacity to work properly. Therefore, the internal storage capacity available is a bit less than specified.

8.	I have upgraded the firmware and I no longer have any multimedia file nor wallpapers. How can I retrieve the contents that came preinstalled?
Before carrying out any system upgrade, we recommend making a backup of everything you want to keep. In www.energysistem.com/en you will find not only all the content that came preinstalled in your Energy Tablet, but many more multimedia files and additional wallpapers.

9.	What do I have to do to install an application that is not in Google#trade# Play Store?
First of all, make sure that the file has the Android#trade# installation extension (.APK). Then, Android#trade# will ask you to activate app installation through the "Unknown sources" option, which has been disabled for security reasons. To enable the installation of apps, please follow the instructions on screen the first time you try to install an application: Settings / Security / Unknown sources (activate). 

10.	The battery life of my Energy Tablet does not match the one indicated in this manual. Why?
Battery life depends largely on how you use the device, that is, how high you set the level of screen brightness, the use of headphones or its built-in speaker, the Wi-Fi settings or the power required for the apps and games that are running.
