## PC Connection.

In order to enjoy the best sound for your favorite music with your MP3 Energy, you have to first copy the music files from your PC to its internal memory.

Connect your player to a free USB port of your computer using the USB connector. The device will be detected automatically without
installing any driver. Once detected, you can read/write to the deviceâ€™s memory just as if you where using a regular disk drive. After all the data is transferred, disconnect the player from the computer.

**IMPORTANT:** To avoid any data loss, always perform a safe USB device extraction before disconnecting the USB cable from the device of
the PC. In Windows XP, for example, you can find the safe extraction icon in the task bar, next to the system clock.
