## Battery.

Your *MP3 Energy* has an integrated rechargeable Li-Ion battery. It comes fully charged from factory, but it is recommended to perform a full recharge before the first use.

Recharge the battery connecting the player to a computer using the bundled USB 2.0 cable.

Charging time is between 2 and 3 hours, depending if the player is powered off or working. To keep the battery in good conditions, we recommend not using the player while charging and not leaving it charging for more than 8 hours.

Your *MP3 Energy* uses two systems for battery saving: It can power off the OLED display after some seconds of inactivity, and it can power off completely after some minutes of inactivity. Both systems are configurable, respectively, browsing the menus SETTINGS -> Backlight time set, and SETTINGS -> Power off. In order to maximize the batteryâ€™s lifespan, it is adviced to not disable completely these power saving features.
