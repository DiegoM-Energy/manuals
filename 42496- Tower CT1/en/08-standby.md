## Turn On / Off Standby mode

When connecting the tower to the power outlet, turn your *Energy Tower CT1 Bluetooth* on using the switch located in the rear part of the tower.  Then you will be able to switch it on and off using the PLAY button () on the top display by pressing it for 2 seconds.

If you are not using the tower for a long period of time, in addition to switching it off in the top display, we recommend switching it "OFF" also in the rear panel.
