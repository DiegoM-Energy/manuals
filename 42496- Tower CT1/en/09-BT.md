## Bluetooth pairing

Press the FUNCTION CHANGE () button to select the Bluetooth mode, then you will see "bt" in the display. 

In that moment you can pair it with your Bluetooth device. When you see the name "Energy Tower" in your Bluetooth device, just select connect and a few seconds the connection will be done.

When the pairing is done you can start to play your music without cables. The tower will always pair automatically with that device. If you want to change your paired BluetoothÂ® device, press the PLAY/PAUSE button for 2 seconds to start a new search.

In addition, the *Energy Tower CT1 Bluetooth* is provided with the Bluetooth profiles A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) that lets you listen to stereo music and the AVRCP (Audio Video Remote Control Profile) by which you can control the music from the top panel or from remote control.
