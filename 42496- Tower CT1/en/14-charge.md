## Alarm clock

From your *Energy Tower CT1 Bluetooth* you can see the time on the top panel and programme it to automatically turn on or off at a certain time. This way, you can use it as an alarm clock.

## Time set

To set the time press the CLOCK button on your remote control and then hold down the PLAY/PAUSE button on the top panel, so the hour digits start flashing. At this moment, press the VOLUME + and VOLUME - buttons to change the time. To confirm the selected time, press again the PLAY/PAUSE button and you will be able to change the minute digits at the same time.

## Switch off/on time set

Using the T-ON and T-OFF buttons on the remote control lets you set the switch on/off time.
To set the switch on time press the T-ON button, then enter the time you want using the number buttons on the remote control.  Follow the same procedure to set the switch off when using the T-OFF button.
To keep the programme set you must switch the tower off from the ON/OFF () button on the top panel. The set will be lost if you put the rear switch off or disconnect the power cable of the tower.
When your Energy Tower CT1 Bluetooth automatically switches on at the time set, it will start playing from the last mode, the last song or the last selected station and volume.
