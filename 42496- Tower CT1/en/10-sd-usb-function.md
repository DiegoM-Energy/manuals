## SD and USB playback

In order to play MP3 files, insert an external memory such as a USB stick or a SD memory card in the corresponding slots, (1) and (2) respectively.

In that moment the *Energy Tower CT1 Bluetooth* will automatically play from the inserted memory. 
"USB or "SD" will be displayed depending on the memory type.

If you switch off the *Energy Tower CT1 Bluetooth* or remove the external memory of your device. 

When you insert again the same external memory, the lecture will continue at the same instant that you ended previously.
To go forward or backward a song keep the NEXT (7) or PREVIOUS (9) pressed. To change the folder press the FOLDER CHANGE (11) button.

## Playback mode

By pressing the RPT button in the remote control, you can choose one of these 3 options:
1) ALL: All the content repeats.

The folders contained in the external memories are read in writing chronological order and all songs contained in these folders are read in alphabetical order.

For example: if after copying two folders of music called 'A' and 'B', we can copy first folder 'B' and later folder 'A', so the first played song will be first song in alphabetical order of 'B' folder.
Here you have a diagram of the reading order:

1) FOLD: The folder you are listening repeats.

2) ONE: The song you are listening repeats.

3) RAND: Random play back of all the content.
