## Playback order

The folders included in the memories are read in chronological order and all songs contained in these folders are read in alphabetical order.

For example: after creating two folders called ‘A’ and ‘B’, we copy first the ‘B’ folder and then the ‘A’ folder. This way the first played song will be the first one from the ‘B’ folder.

Here you have a diagram of the reading order:
