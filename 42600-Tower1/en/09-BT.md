## Bluetooth pairing

Once switched on, press *Change mode (5)* and select Bluetooth mode. Then, the *LED mode indicator (1)* on the top panel will start glowing. This will be the default mode every time you switch on your tower. 

When the *LED mode indicator (1)* starts flashing in blue, your tower will be ready to be synchronized with your Bluetooth device.

Press "connect" when you see the name "Energy Tower 1" in your Bluetooth device's display. The devices will be connected immediately and without codes. You will hear a confirmation sound when both devices are synchronized. 

As soon as the connection is set, you will be able to play your track list in wireless mode.

If you want to synchronize another device, keep the *Change mode (5)* button pressed for 2 seconds to start a new search. You can also switch Bluetooth mode off and then switch it on again by pressing the *Change mode (5)* button repeatedly and shortly. 

Furthermore, your Energy Tower 1 features both Bluetooth A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) and AVRCP (Audio Video Remote Control Profile) profiles. The former will let you listen to your music in stereo mode and the latter will allow you to control the playback with the top panel buttons.
