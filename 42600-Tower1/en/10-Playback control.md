## Playback control

Once your *Energy Tower 1* is synchronized with other device, you can control the volume from the tower  itself. To do so, press *Volume + (6)* or *Volume - (7)*. If you reach the maximum volume permitted, you will hear that the music playback suddenly stops.

To start, pause or resume playback, press the *Play - Pause (4)* button.

To move to the previous or the following track, press *Next (2)* or *Back (3)*.
