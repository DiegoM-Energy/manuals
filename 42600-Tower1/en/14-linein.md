## 3.5 mm audio-in (AUX)

Your Energy Tower 1 features an *3.5 mm audio-in (AUX) (9)* which allows you to connect your music player using a 3.5 mm jack audio cable.

This audio-in is situated in the top panel, with the name "Aux2". To use it, connect one end of the 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm jack audio cable to the audio-in *(9)* and the other end to the device audio-out (MP3 player, laptop, smartphone, etc). 

Press *Change mode (5)* and select "Aux2" mode while your Energy Tower 1 is on. The  *LED mode indicator (1)* on the top panel will show the selected mode.

When the "Aux2" playback mode is enabled, your Energy Tower 1 is in speaker mode. This means that the content played by your audio device (external player) as well as all volume, equalizer or track changes will be heard through the Energy Tower 1.

To start, pause or resume playback use *Play - Pause (4)* button.

Keep in mind that you will not be able to change track with the *Next (2)* and *Back (3)* buttons while the auxiliary audio-in is in use. Instead, you must do it through the audio device (external player) connected.
