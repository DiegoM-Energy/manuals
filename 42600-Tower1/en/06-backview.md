## Rear panel

You will find the power switch of your *Energy Tower 1* as well as two power controllers for high and low frequencies on its rear panel (shown as "TREBLE" and "BASS").


### Switching on and off the device. Stand-by mode.

Once the *Energy Tower 1* has been plugged into a socket, turn it on by moving the power switch on the back side of the tower to the "ON" position. At that moment, you can switch it on and off by keeping the *Play - Pause (4)* button on the top panel pressed for 2 seconds.

If you are not going to use the tower for a long period of time, we recommend, not only to switch it off from the top panel but also to turn the power switch to the "OFF" position.
