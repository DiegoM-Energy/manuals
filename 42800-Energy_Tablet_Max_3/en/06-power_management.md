## Charging the device

Your Energy Tablet has a rechargeable 6000 mAh battery. We recommend to charge the battery completely before using the device for the first time. To do so, always connect your device to the power supply through the adapter provided with the product. The charging time ranges from 4 to 6 hours, depending on whether the device is on or off. Always charge your tablet through the USB cable and the power adapter that come with the product to comply with the battery charging times.
