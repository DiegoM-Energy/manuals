## Call control

Once your *Energy Headphones 7 Bluetooth ANC* and smartphone are synchronized, you will be able to answer calls thanks to the built-in microphone while wearing your headphones.

Use the MULTIFUNCTION button (2) to answer an incoming call. If you are listening to music when you receive a call, playback will pause and you will hear an incoming call sound. You can also press and hold this button for 2 seconds to reject an incoming call.

Press the MULTIFUNCTION button (2) again to end a call. Playback will resume from the point when the music stopped.
