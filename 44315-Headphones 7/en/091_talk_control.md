If you run out of battery or simply do not want to use the wireless connection, you can also connect your *Energy Headphones 7 Bluetooth ANC* to your music player using the audio cable provided. You don't need to switch on your headphones if you want to enable line-in mode (audio cable).

Simply connect the cable provided to the AUDIO INPUT (7) to enable this mode.

**Important:** *You will not be able to control playback from the headphones while this mode is on so you will have to adjust the volume and switch to the previous/next song from your music player*.
