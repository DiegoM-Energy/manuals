## Bluetooth playback control

Once your *Energy Headphones 7 Bluetooth ANC* are syncronized, you will be able to control basic playback functions such as turning up and down the volume and switching to the next or previous song directly from your headphones.

Press the VOLUME + (1) and VOLUME - (3) buttons to turn up and down the volume respectively. You will hear a beep when reaching the maximum volume level.

Press and hold the NEXT button (1) to switch to the next song. You can also press and hold the BACK button (3) to go back to the previous song.

Press the MULTIFUNCTION button (2) once to pause or resume playback. 

**Note:** Your *Energy Headphones 7 Bluetooth ANC* will automatically turn off if music is paused for more than 30 minutes in order to save battery.*

**Note 2:** *If you are using the audio cable instead of the Bluetooth connection, you will have to control music playback from your music player and not from the headphones.*
