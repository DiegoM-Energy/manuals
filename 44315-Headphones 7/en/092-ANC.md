## ANC (Active Noise Cancelling). System to reduce background noise

Press the ANC button (5) to enable and disable the active noise cancelling mode. The ANC INDICATOR (4) glows when this option is enabled. You don't need to switch on your headphones to enable this mode. 

You can enable ANC on your *Energy Headphones 7 ANC* while either the Bluetooth mode or AUX mode (audio cable) is enabled. If you are studying or sleeping on a plane, you can also enable this function while not listening to music to cancel background noise.

**Important:** *For security reasons, we recommend to disable ANC while walking on the street or carrying out activities in which noise reduction may put users at risk.*
