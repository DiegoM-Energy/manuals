### Charging the battery

When the headphones stop playing music or start emitting interferences, it is time to recharge them by connecting the USB mini plug to the *Energy Headphones BT9 Bluetooth* (13), and the other USB end to any device with a USB port capable of providing energy (PC, USB wall charger, car, etc.). The LED (4) will light red when charging and it will light blue when the charging process has been completed.


**IMPORTANT NOTE:** To keep the battery in a good condition, we strongly recommend not to charge the battery until it is completely empty. Also, do not interrupt the charging process until the battery is fully charged.
