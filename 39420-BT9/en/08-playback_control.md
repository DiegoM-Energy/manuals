## Playback control

Once your *Energy BT9 Headphones Bluetooth* are synced, you will be able to control basic playback functions directly from the headset such as: volume up and down, forward and backward, play and pause.

If you want to listen to another track press the forward button (5) once and in case you want to fast-forward the song you are listening to, hold that same button until you reach the desired point in a song. You can also rewind songs by pressing and holding the backward button (7).

You can raise and lower the volume using the buttons (3) and (6). You will hear a "beep" sound with each volume change and a higher “beep” sound when the max. volume is reached.

To pause or resume your music press the Bluetooth button (1) once.
