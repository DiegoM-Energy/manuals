## Micro SD

To play MP3 files, insert a Micro SD card into the slot (11).

If you turn off the * Energy Headphones BT9 Bluetooth* or remove the Micro SD card, the song you were listening to will be stored in the deviceâ€™s internal memory. When inserting the Micro SD card again, the headphones will resume the song you were listening to at the moment it stopped.

To listen to another track, press the FORWARD (5) and BACKWARD (7) button.

If you want to select the Bluetooth function directly from the Micro SD Playback Mode, simply press the Bluetooth button (1).
