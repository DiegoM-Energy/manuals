## Line-In / USB Mode

In addition to the playback modes described so far, if you run out of battery or just do not want to use a wireless connection you have two more options to enjoy your *Energy Headphones BT9 Bluetooth*: connect to your player using the audio cable or, connect to a PC using the USB cable (both included).

To use these modes you must turn off your Energy Headphones BT9 Bluetooth and connect the cable to the line-in port (12) or micro USB port(14).

If you want to use an external player but keep the connection with your smartphone to answer and make calls; once connected by USB or by line-in, press the bluetooth button (1) of the Energy Headphones BT9 Bluetooth and they will connect to your smartphone but will listen to the music from the source you had previously connected and if you receive or make a call the behavior will be the same as described in Chapter 9 of this manual.

NOTE: In these modes, the playback control will not be available so to raise and lower the volume, change tracks or pause the music you will have to do it from the player connected to the headphones.
