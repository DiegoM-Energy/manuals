## Line-In 

In addition to the playback modes described so far, if you run out of battery or just do not want to use a wireless connection you have one more option to enjoy your *Energy Headphones BT9 Bluetooth*: connect them to your player using the audio cable included.

To use this mode turn off your *Energy Headphones BT9 Bluetooth* and connect the cable to the line-in port (12).

NOTE: In this mode, the playback control will not be available so to raise and lower the volume, change tracks or pause the music you will have to do it from the player connected to the headphones.
