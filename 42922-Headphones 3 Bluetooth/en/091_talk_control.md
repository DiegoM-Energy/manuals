## Audio input

In addition to all modes explained so far, you can also connect your *Energy Headphones 3 Bluetooth* to your music player using the included audio cable if you run out of battery or simply do not want to use the wireless connection.

Connect the cable that comes with the product to the AUDIO-IN (7) to use this mode.

**Important:** You will not be able to control playback from the headphones while this mode is on so you will have to use your music player to turn up and down the volume, switch to previous/next song or pause playback.
