## Turning the device On and Off

To turn on your eReader Slim HD, hold the on / off button / standby (10) until the startup image appears. To turn off the eReader, hold the button until a warning window appears, select turn off in the screen. A short press of this button  will put your eReader on standby mode, which is a special low-power mode that lets you instantly return to the last screen by just pushing the button again.

When your eReader is in standby mode or switched off, it will display an image on the display indicating their status. Do not worry, this image does not consume energy.
