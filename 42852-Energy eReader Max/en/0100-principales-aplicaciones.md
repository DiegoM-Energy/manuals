*Dictionary*

Your Energy eReader Max has a function called "Dictionary" that allows you to install any database that supports *StarDict* format, one of the most extended electronic formats used for online dictionaries. These databases have been created with free GNU (GPL) tools.

You will be able to use both the dictionaries from renowned publishers and free dictionaries created by communities or even create your own dictionaries.

In order to be able to use the Dictionary app on your Energy eReader, you have to download the files of the dictionary you prefer to your computer first. Dictionaries that support *StarDict* format usually consist of 3 files in *.dz (o *.dict), *.idz (or *.idx) and *.ifo formats. You will need the three of them to use the dictionary. Please follow these easy steps to install them on your Energy eReader: 

- 1) Connect your Energy eReader to your computer and access its internal memory using the file explorer in your computer.
- 2) Once you have opened the main or root folder, create a folder and call it "dict" (for instance, x:/dict/)
- 3) Copy the dictionaries in this folder or create subfolders with the names of the dictionaries that you want to add (Drae, Catalan-Spanish, etc...)
- 4) Once the installation is completed, restart your e-book reader.

Once the dictionaries are installed and you have restarted the e-book reader, you will be able to use this function while the device is in read mode by pressing for a few seconds the word that you would like and choosing *Reference* in the pop-up window.

### Notepad:
