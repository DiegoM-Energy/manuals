## Charging the device

Your Energy eReader Max has a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Connect one end of the microUSB cable (included) to any charger with USB type A port or your computer and the other cable end to the *microUSB port (2)* that is to be found at the bottom of the device.

It takes between 3 and 5 hours to charge the battery depending on the type of charger you choose.
