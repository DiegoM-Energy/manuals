## Introduction

Thank you for your trust in us and for buying the new Energy eReader Max. We hope you enjoy it.

Your new e-book reader features a 6" E-Ink Carta touchscreen with anti-glare system to avoid glare and reflection while reading in the sunshine and from different viewing angles. Thanks to the Wi-Fi connection and Android operating system you will be able to open thousands of apps. All these features, the advanced reading settings and the 8 GB internal memory turn your device into the perfect partner for your reading sessions.

We strongly recommend to read this manual in order to familiarize yourself with your eReader before you start using it. It will only take a few minutes and it will help you to make the most of all its features.
