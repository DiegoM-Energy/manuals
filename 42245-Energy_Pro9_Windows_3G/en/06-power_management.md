## <quick_guide> Battery Management/First use

Your Energy Tablet has a rechargeable lithium ion battery. Initially the battery is charged at factory, but it is highly recommended to perform a full charge before the first use.
Recharge the battery connecting the device to the AC/DC 5V included with the product. The charging time ranges from 3-5 hours, depending on whether the device is off or running. In order to keep the battery in good condition, we recommend that you turn it off while charging and not leave it charging more than 8 hours.

You have several ways to improve the performance and optimize the battery use of your Energy Tablet:
Set your tablet to automatically turn off the display after a few seconds of inactivity and select an ideal display brightness to enlarge the battery life.

To use your phone card insert it on the SIM slot into the correct position
