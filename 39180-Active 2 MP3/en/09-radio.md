## FM Radio.

Your MP3 Energy has an integrated FM radio with 20 presets and direct recording. To listen to the radio, select the RADIO option in the main menu. The player will position at the same station that you had selected last time.

With the NEXT/PREVIOUS buttons you can browse the FM frequency range. With single pressings you will advance/return one step, and holding the buttons will perform auto searches. In case you position the dial on a broadcast with a preset, its number will appear at the middle of the screen. With single pressing on the PLAY button you can browse up the presets available in memory. Holding VOLUME +/- will increase/decrease the volume respectively.

You can access the radio options submenu by pressing the MENU button while on the FM radio frequency screen. Browse through the different options with the VOLUME+/- buttons and select one by pressing the PLAY button:

1. "Auto Search": It scans the frequency range and stores the first 20 broadcasts in the presets.

2. "Save": Allows you to save the broadcast currently selected inside the next free preset. If the 20 presets are all occupied the last one will be overwritten.

3. "Delete": Choose this option to erase the currently selected preset.

4. "Delete all": Erases all current presets.

5. "Record": You can record the current FM broadcast on WAV files. Press the PLAY button to begin recording, and pause/resume the recording by pressing PLAY button once again. To finish the recording press the MENU button. To exit the FM record mode back to the frequency screen, hold the MENU button.

6. "Exit": Brings you back to the frequency screen. Alternatively you can go back at any time pressing MENU.
