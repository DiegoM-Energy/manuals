**Nota:** Special function keys such as forward, back, play, pause, go to, page scrolling, context menu, etc. may not be compatible with all apps. The app must be compatible with the remote control. Some apps are exclusively designed to be used with a touch screen (tablet, smartphone...). For this type of apps we recommend using the remote control's *mouse mode* ![Mouse](http://static.energysistem.com/images/manuals/42162/55008780a55de.jpg), or acquiring a mouse. You can use a USB or IR mouse, provided that it has a IR receptor or USB port.

In order to use the remote control, point it towards the front part of the cable receptor. The remote control's cable receptor has a sensor with an adhesive surface for placing it in a simple and easy way on the TV front Clean the surface with alcohol and make sure to place it on a smooth surface before sticking it to the TV front. Remove the adhesive protector and stick it near the TV.

Avoid blocking the signal between the remote control and the receptor to ensure a better signal.
The remote control features three IR transmitters: one on the upper side and two on the QWERTY keyboard's upper side. Up to 7 meters of range of use in a 40º angle in both directions.  At this point we recommend you to replace the old batteries for new, alkaline one's.

**Battery replacement.**

Remove the cover from the remote control and place in 2 AAA batteries. The diagram below shows how to correctly place in the batteries.
