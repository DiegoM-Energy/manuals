Almost all devices with android 4.2 and newer feature Miracast#trade# technology, which consists in a new multimedia protocol that helps to transmit audio and video between smartphones, tablets, TV, players, etc. via Wi-Fi.

You will be able to enjoy audio and video content stored on mobile devices on your TV. It is not necessary for both devices to be connected to the internet, although it is advisable to have the source device connected in case you want to download and share content.

You can check the compatibility with your Android devices in **Settings / Screen / Cast Screen** or **Wireless Screen**. 

Follow these easy steps in order to authorise the screen of a device on your Android TV Play:

1. Press the button ![Miracast](http://static.energysistem.com/images/manuals/42162/55001fcc851ce.jpg) on the remote control of your Android TV Play or run the *Wireless screen* app. The device will enter signal reception mode. 
2. Enable the wireless screen on the device you want to connect to your Android TV Play. To do so, go to **Seettings / Screen / Cast Screen** or **Wireless Screen** and check the appropriate box. You can also rename the device. 
3. Press **"detect a device"** on your Android TV Play and authorise the connection between both devices.

The only thing left to do is to search for your Android TV Play on your authorised devices. To do so, go to *Cast Screen* or *Wireless screen* in order to transform your TV in a "mirror" that reflects all that happens on your devices.
