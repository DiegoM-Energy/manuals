## Line in

To use the line-in function, connect the audio cable in the line-in port (10) by one side (you can see “Aux” in the display), and connect the other side to another audio device like MP3 player, smartphone, tablet, etc.

At the time that the cable is connected to the input line (11), the "Line-in" mode is automatically activated and you can visualize "AUX" on the main display.

In "Line-in" mode the *Energy Tower 8* is in speaker mode, so that what is played on the audio device (external player) or modifications made to volume or EQ will be heard in the *Energy Tower 8*.
