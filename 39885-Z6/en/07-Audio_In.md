## Audio-In

To use the Audio-In function, connect one end of the audio cable (included) in the LINE-IN connector (13), and the other end in the output of any audio device, such like an MP3 player, a laptop or Smartphone.

Your *Energy Music Box Z6* must be turned on in order to use this function.

**NOTE:** While using the device in Audio-In mode, it is not possible to control the playback neither the volume from the speaker. You have to do it from the player connected.
