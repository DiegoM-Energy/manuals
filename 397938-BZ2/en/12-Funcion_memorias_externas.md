## FUNCIÃ“N MP3 CON MEMORIAS EXTERNAS

In order to play MP3/WMA files, insert an external Micro SD/SDHC memory card in the indicated slot (10).

If you switch off the *Energy Bike Music Box BZ2 Bluetooth* or remove the Micro SD/SDHC, the player will start playing the first song when you insert again the same external memory, or switch on the device. The first song will be the first one you save in the Micro SD/SDHC memory card.

Change the track by using the NEXT (4) and PREVIOUS (3) buttons. This will go directly to next track, press and keep MODE (3) button pressed, during 2 seconds.

To quick forward or backward the song, keep the NEXT (4) or PREVIOUS (3) buttons. By releasing the button, the playback will continue normally.
