## <quick_guide> Power management

To use the Energy Wireless Charger Qi, it must be connected previously to a socket, computer or other device via the microUSB port (4). Inside the product you will find a microUSB-USB cable for the connection. In order to connect it to a socket you can use the AC/DC adapter included in the Energy Phone Pro Qi or another with similar specifications 5V/1A (not included).

Then, you only need to place your Energy Phone Pro Qi (or other smartphone which addmitts wireless charger) above the charger. For a correct operation (6), your smartphone should be centered on the charger because the emitter and receiver coils must be aligned. The transfer of energy will be correct if the LED of the Energy Wireless Charger Qi blinks green.

Do not place metal or magnetic objects between the wireless charger and the smartphone to prevent an inadequate charge.
