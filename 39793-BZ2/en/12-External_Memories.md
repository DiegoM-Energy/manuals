## MP3 Function with External Memory

In order to play MP3/WMA files, insert an external Micro SD/SDHC memory card in the Micro SD slot (10).

If you switch off the *Energy Bike Music Box BZ2 Bluetooth* or remove the Micro SD/SDHC, the player will start playing the first song when you switch on the device or insert again the same external memory. The first song played will be the first one you save in the Micro SD/SDHC memory card.

Change the track by using the NEXT (3) and PREVIOUS (7) buttons. This will go directly to next track. Also you can advance to the next folder by pressing the BROWSE button (4).
