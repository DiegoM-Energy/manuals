## Line in

In order to use the line-in function connect the audio cable to the line-in port (10) (you will see “Aux” on the display) and to an MP3 player, smartphone, tablet, etc.

When using the "Line-in" function the *Energy Tower 3* will enter "speaker mode", meaning that all the music being played as well as the volume and EQ settings done on the external device will be applied to the *Energy Tower 3*.
