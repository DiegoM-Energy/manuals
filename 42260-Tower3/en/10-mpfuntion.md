## MP3 playback using SD memory cards and USB external devices

To play MP3 files, insert an external memory such as a USB stick or a SD/MMC memory card in (13) and (11) respectively.

The *Energy Tower 3* will automatically start playing music from an pluged-in memory device.

The *Energy Tower 3* will save the moment where the song stopped whenever you switch it off or remove the external memory.

It will resume the song where it stopped when switching it on or inserting the external memory.

Use the forward (12) and backward (2) buttons if you want to skip or listen to a previous song. Press the (4) button to change the folder.

## Playback order

Folders inside external memory devices are read in chronological order and all songs contained in these folders are read in alphabetical order.

Here is a diagram of the reading order:
