## Power switch. Stand by mode.

Connect your *Energy Tower 3* to a power outlet and turn the ON/OFF switch, located on back of the tower,  to the ON position. Now you will be able to turn ON/OFF the device by pressing the "PLAY" button, located on the top panel, for two seconds (stand-by mode).

We recommend you to switch the tower off when not being used in a longer period of time.
