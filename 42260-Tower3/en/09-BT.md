## Bluetooth function

Use the mode(5) button to select the Bluetooth function; "bt" will appear on the display. Now you will be able to sync your devices via Bluetooth.

Your *Energy Tower 3* will be shown on your device's display as "Energy Tower 3". Select it and the sycing will be done.

After pairing both devices you will be ready to go and enjoy your music without any cables.

If you want to sync and pair another Bluetooth device, press button (4) for two seconds; the tower will start searching for a new device/-es. You can also do this by disabling/enabling the Bluetooth function.

The *Energy Tower 3* also features the Bluetooth A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) and AVRC (Audio Video Remote Control Profile) profiles, which allow you to listen to your music in stereo quality and control your music playback directly from the Energy Tower 3 or using a remote control.
