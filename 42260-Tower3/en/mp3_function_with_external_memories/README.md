## MP3 function with external memories
In order to play MP3 files, insert an external memory such as a USB stick or
a SD/MMC memory card in the corresponding slots; (1) and (2) respectively.
If you switch off the Energy TS3 or remove the external memory of your
device, when you insert again the same external memory, the lecture will
continue at the same instant that you ended previously.
To go forward another track, use next (10) and back (9) buttons. This will go
directly to next or previous track.
