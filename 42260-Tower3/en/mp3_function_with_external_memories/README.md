## MP3 function with external memories

In order to play MP3 files, insert an external memory such as a USB stick or a SD/MMC memory card in the corresponding slots, () and () respectively.

If you switch off the *Energy Tower 3* or remove the external memory of your device, when you insert again the same external memory, the lecture will continue at the same instant that you ended previously.

To go forward another track, use next () and back () buttons. This will go directly to next or previous track.

## Playback order

The folders included in the memories are read in writing chronological order and all songs contained in these folders are read in alphabetical order.

For example: if after copying two folders of music called ‘A’ and ‘B’, we can copy first folder ‘B’ and later folder ‘A’, so the first played song will be first song in alphabetical order of ‘B’ folder.

Here you have a diagram of the reading order:
