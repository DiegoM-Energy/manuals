## Power switch. Stand by mode.

First, connect your *Energy Tower 3* to power supply and put the rear switch in "ON" position. Thereafter, you can turn on and off from the "PLAY" button on the top panel, keeping it pressed for 2 seconds (stand-by mode).

We recommend that when the tower is not in use for a long period of time, put "OFF" the rear switch.
