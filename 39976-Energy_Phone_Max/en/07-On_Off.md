## <quick_guide> Switching On and Off
Before turning on your Energy Phone, make sure that the SIM cards are inserted in their slots. After that, press the power button (13) located on the upper right side of your device for a few seconds. When the operating system has loaded, unlock the device to start using it. Enter the PIN number of your SIM cards and then drag the padlock outside the circle using your finger.
