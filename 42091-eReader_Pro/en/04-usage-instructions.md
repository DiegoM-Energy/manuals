##<quick_guide> Usage instructions

**Battery Management/First use:**

Your Energy eReader Pro has a rechargeable lithium battery. Initially the battery is charged at the factory, but it is highly recommended that you perform a full charge before the first use. Recharge the battery by connecting the device to the outlet through a transformer or to your computer using the USB-microUSB cable included with the product. The charging time ranges between 3-5 hours, depending on if the device is turned off or running. In order to keep the battery in good condition, we recommend that you turn it off while charging and not leave it charging more than 8 hours.


**Switching On and Off:**

To switch on your eReader, press the power button (1) during a few seconds. To turn off your eReader, hold the power button (1) until the power off menu appears, and press the option “turn off”. One press of the power button (1) locks/unlocks the eReader. On the lock or switch off mode, the device shows a picture on the screen.
