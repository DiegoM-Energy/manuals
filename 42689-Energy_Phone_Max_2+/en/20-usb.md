## MicroSD / USB

Your Energy Phone Max 2+ has a slot for microSD cards to expand your device memory. To use it, turn off your device before inserting/extracting the card in order to avoid accidental data loss.  It supports High Capacity \(microSD-HC\) and Extended Capacity \(microSD-XC\) card formats.

Your Energy Phone has also a microUSB port to connect USB cables and interact with your PC in different ways. You only need to connect the cable that comes with the product to the PC to establish the connection and enjoy all mode functions.
