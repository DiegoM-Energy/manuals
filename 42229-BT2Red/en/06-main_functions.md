### Charging the battery

When there are about 15 minutes remaining, the headphones will emit a beep sound to warn you of this situation. This sound will be repeated every minute until the battery runs out.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To keep the battery in good condition, it is strongly recommended not to charge battery until it runs out completely. Also, do not interrupt the charging process or use the headphones until the battery is fully charged.
