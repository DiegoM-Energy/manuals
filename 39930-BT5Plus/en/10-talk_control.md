## Talk Control

Once you have paired your *Energy Wireless BT5+* with your mobilephone or smartphone, you can receive phone calls and use the built-in microphone to speak from the headphones. To answer an incoming call, press the button (1) and when you finish, press the button (1) again to end the call. If you are listening to music when you receive a call, the music will be paused and when you end the call, the music will resume.
