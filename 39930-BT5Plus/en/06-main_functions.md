### Charging the battery

When your device does not emit any sound or you start hearing some interference in short distance, it is time to charge it. Connect the mini USB end of the included USB cable to your *Energy Wireless BT5+* (5) and the other end to any USB port that can provide energy (PC, USB wall charger, car, etc).
