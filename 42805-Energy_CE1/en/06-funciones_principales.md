When the battery level is below 10%, you will hear a sound to remind you to charge it through the *CHARGING CONNECTION* (6). 

To charge it, connect the mini USB end of the USB cable (included) to the *CHARGING PORT* (6) and the other USB end to any device with an USB charging port to provide energy (PC, USB wall charger, car charger, etc).
