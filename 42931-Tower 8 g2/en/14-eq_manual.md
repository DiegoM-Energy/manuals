## Sound equalizer

The device has two controllers at the back that enable users to adjust equalization:

* Adjust Mid/Treble (This function is indicated as "Treble")
* Adjust Bass (This function is indicated as "Bass")

**Important**: We recommend to adjust equalization if you connect a second *Energy Tower 8 g2* to the RCA output. In this specific case, we recommend that the "Treble" level is half of the "Bass"level.
