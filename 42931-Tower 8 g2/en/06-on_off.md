## Switching on and off the device

Once the *Energy Tower 8 g2* has been plugged into a socket, turn it on by moving the *power switch (30)* on the back side of the tower to the "ON" position. From that moment on, you can turn it on or off by pressing the *On/ Off button (8)* on the top panel for 2 seconds or the *On/ Off button (10)* on the remote control.

If you are not going to use the tower for a long period of time, we recommend to turn the power switch on the back side to the "OFF" position. 


## Change function
In order to select different functions, press *Change mode (2) or (11)*. You will be able to see the selected function on the *display (6)*. 

In case that there are no units connected to the rear inputs ('USB', 'MicroSD', 'AUX 1' or 'AUX 2'), the *Change mode (2) or (11)* button will switch between FM Radio, Bluetooth, Aux (line-in) or RCA.

In case that all inputs are being used, the *Change mode (2) or (11)* will switch from one to another in the following order:

 USB -> microSD -> Bluetooth -> Aux -> RCA -> Optical -> FM Radio
