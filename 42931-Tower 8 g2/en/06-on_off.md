## Switching on and off the device

Once the *Energy Tower 8 g2* has been plugged into a socket, turn it on by moving the *power switch (30)* on the back side of the tower to the "ON" position. From that moment on, you can turn it on or off by pressing the *On/ Off button (8)* on the top panel for 2 seconds or the *On/ Off button (10)* on the remote control.

If you are not going to use the tower for a long period of time, we recommend to turn the power switch on the back side to the "OFF" position.
