## Optical input

Connect any device with a digital output (TV, amplifier, Hi-Fi player, etc) to the optical input using an S/PDIF optical cable. After doing so, change the selected mode by pressing the *Change mode (2) or (11)* button until you see the word "Optical" appear on the *Display (6)*. 

This way you will be able to play .wav or .flac files without interruption and make the most of your "Energy Tower 8 g2".
