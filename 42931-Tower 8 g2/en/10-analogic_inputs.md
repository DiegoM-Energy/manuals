## Mini jack and RCA inputs (analogue inputs)

Your *Energy Tower 8 g2* features two analogue stereo inputs to connect external devices. The first one is a mini jack input (cable provided with the product) and the other one is a RCA audio-in. 

#### Mini Jack input
Your *Energy Tower 8 g2* features an *Audio-in for 3.5 mm jack (24)* which allows you to connect your music player using a 3.5 mm jack audio cable. 

Once you connect the cable to this input, "Line-in" mode will be enabled automatically and you will see the word "AUX" on the *Display (6)*. You will be able to change function even if the cable is still connected.

To start, pause or resume playback use the *Play / Pause (4)* button on the panel or on the remote control *(18)*. 
We recommend to use this input to connect small devices such as mp3 players or smartphones. 

#### RCA input
This audio-in is situated on the top panel with the name "INPUT". It has been conceived to connect your TV or audio devices permanently. 

You will be able to enable and disable this input using the *Change mode (2) or (11)* button.

We recommend to use this input to connect audio systems such as stack systems, televisions or mixing desks permanently. 


**Important:** In both cases, you will have to control music playback (volume, equalizer or track changes) from the external device that has been synchronized with your *Energy Tower 8 g2*.
