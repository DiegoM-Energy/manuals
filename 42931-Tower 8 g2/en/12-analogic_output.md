## RCA audio-out (analogue output)

Your *Energy Tower 8 g2* features a *RCA audio output (analogue output) (29)* which allows you to connect other self-powered speakers that have an analogue input in order to hear your music simultaneously through several speakers.

You can even connect a second *Energy Tower 8 g2* to your tower using a RCA male to RCA male stereo cable. To do that, connect one end of the cable to the output of the first tower and the other end to the input of the second tower. The signal will be transferred to the second tower, regardless of the enabled playback mode (BT, Optical, USB, microSD, AUX or Radio) and music will be played on both devices simultaneously.
