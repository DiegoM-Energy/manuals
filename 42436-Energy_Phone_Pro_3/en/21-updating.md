## Updates

Your Energy Phone Pro 3 has an Androidâ„¢ operating system that can be reinstalled or updated if necessary. Updates will be carried out via OTA (Over-The-Air) by default, so your Energy Phone will automatically connect to our servers, download the file and install the new software as soon as an update is released.

You can also update your Energy Phone Pro 3 using your PC. The process is simple but has to be done carefully and only when is really necessary. If the device does not respond, restarts unexpectedly or you experience problems accessing the content stored on the built-in memory, you should reinstall or update the operating system to the latest compatible version available.

Please follow these steps to install it:

1. Make sure that the battery of your Energy Phone Pro 3 is fully charged. If this is not the case, plug it into an external power source using the provided AC/DC power adapter and wait until it is fully charged.

2. Access the www.energysistem.com/en website from your computer.

3. Access the "Support" section and choose "Smartphone" in type of product.

4. Choose your Energy Phone model from the drop-down list that appears and then download the latest Android#trade# operating system version available.
**Important:**
Please make sure the operating system version you are downloading is intended for your model and serial number, otherwise the device could be damaged.

5. Unzip the file on your computer.

6. Open the text file included in the download and follow the instructions to install the new operating system on your Energy Phone Pro 3.
