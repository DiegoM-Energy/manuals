## MicroSD/ USB

Your Energy Phone Pro 3 has a slot for microSD memory cards to expand your device memory. To use it, turn off your device before inserting/extracting the card in order to avoid accidental data loss. It supports high capacity (microSD-HC) and extended capacity (microSD-XC) card formats.

You can set your microSD card as portable storage or internal storage. If you set your card as portable storage, you will be able to store multimedia content on it. If you set your microSD card as internal storage, it will work as part of the built-in memory of your device and will allow you to save multimedia content and install apps as well. To set this option, you just have to click on the notification that will appear on the screen once you insert an SD card. You can also go to Settings > Storage > Portable storage (or the name of your microSD card) > Settings > Storage settings.
