## Navigation menu

Go to Settings > Navigation (1) if you want to disable the main screen buttons (2) and use the fingerprint sensor to navigate: go back (hold the position), return to Home screen (one tap) or access the recent apps window (double tap). You can also change the order of the main screen buttons (3).
