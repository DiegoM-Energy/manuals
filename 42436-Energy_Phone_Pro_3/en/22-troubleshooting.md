## Troubleshooting

1.	Why is not possible to play some MP3 files?
The MP3 file must follow the Layer 3 Standard for MPEG-1, MPEG-2 or MPEG 2.5 formats. Otherwise, they have to be converted using specific software.

2.	My Energy Phone does not start, what can I do?
Make sure that the battery has enough charge when trying to turn it on. If the problem continues after charging the device for at least 30 minutes, there may be a problem with the installed operating system. Please refer to the "Updates" section of this manual.

3.	Why is not possible to play some WMA files?
Make sure you are not trying to play DRM-protected WMA files.

4.	Why is not possible to play video files, display images or text while using the music player?
In general, applications only display the files that are compatible and that the programme is able to read. Therefore, you will only be able to display the files with the format that is compatible with that programme (songs with the music player, videos with the movie player, etc.) while you browse the folders of that specific application. In order to see all files stored on the built-in memory at the same time, run the file explorer application from the application menu.

5.	Which video formats are compatible with my Energy Phone?
Your Energy Phone can play several video formats like MP4, 3GP or MOV among others without needing to recode.

6.	Why is not possible to display my jpg images?
Many digital cameras and image editing software add hidden data to jpg files. This can prevent your Energy Phone from loading the images. Use another app to save the image and try to open it once again.
7.	Sometimes the screen turns black and the device does not respond.
It is always better to restart the device through one of the available system options but if this is not possible, please restart it by pressing the power and volume + buttons for 10 seconds.

8.	The built-in memory of the Energy Phone 3 is 32 GB but the available memory capacity is lower than that. Why?
The Android#trade# operating system and the pre-installed applications need approximately 8 GB of the built-in memory to work properly. Therefore, the internal storage capacity available is less than 32 GB.

9.	What do I have to do to install an application?
First of all, make sure that the file has the Android#trade# installation extension (.APK). Then, Android#trade# will ask you to activate the app installation from the "Unknown sources" option, which has been disabled for security reasons. To enable the installation of apps, you only have to follow the instructions on screen the first time you try to install an application: Settings / Security / Unknown sources (activate). This action may compromise the device security. Therefore, we strongly recommend to install applications from reliable sources only.

10.	How long does the battery last?
It depends largely on the usage conditions such as the screen brightness, the use of headphones or speakers, whether the Wi-Fi connection is enabled or disabled and the use of GSM, 3G and 4G networks. The battery life of the Energy Phone Pro 3 lasts up to 165 hours on standby and 15 hours in conversation.

11. Which are the bands that my device needs to work in 3G and 4G modes?
Your Energy Phone Pro 3 is prepared for the WCDMA 900/2100 MHz bands to work on 3G mode and for the FDD-LTE 800/1800/2100/2600 MHz bands to work on 4G mode.
