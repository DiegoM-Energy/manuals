## <quick_guide>Bluetooth Pairing

With your *Energy Headphones BT3+ Bluetooth* turned off, press the multifunction button (1) for 6 seconds until the LED indicator (6) starts flahing blue and red, which means that your *Energy Headphones BT3+ Bluetooth* are trying to connect with another Bluetooth device; at the same time start the search and pairing process from your Bluetooth device (smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc). Once you have found the *Energy Headphones BT3+ Bluetooth* in your device, select "Connect" and both devices will pair each other immediately with no need of pairing codes; then the LED indicator (6) will flash only blue which means that the connection has been successfully established.

Your *Energy Headphones BT3+ Bluetooth* allow you to pair a second device without repeting all the pairing process. To do this, you need to activate the multpoint option by pressing once the multifunction button while you are pairing the first device (while LED(6) is flashing in blue and red). You will hear a sound indicating that this option has been activated. By doing this you can use both devices whenever you want without unpairing any of them.
