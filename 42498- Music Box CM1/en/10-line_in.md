## Audio-in input connector.

It is also possible to enjoy your *Energy Music Box CM1 Bluetooth* without pairing it with any Bluetooth device thanks to its AUDIO-IN CONNECTOR (12) in which you can connect an audio cable with a 3.5mm jack connector and the other end to your player.

Your Energy Music Box CM1 Bluetooth must be turned on in order to use this function.

NOTE: While using the device in Audio-In mode, it is not possible to control the playback neither the volume from the speaker. You have to do it from the player connected.
