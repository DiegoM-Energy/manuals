To use the remote control, point it to the front part of the receiver cable. The receiving cable has a sensor with an adhesive surface on the one end to place it on the front of the television.  Before adhering it, and to ensure a secure installation, make sure the surface is completely smooth, clean it with alcohol and dry it completely. Remove the protection from the adhesive material and paste it on a point near the centre of your TV.

Make sure the field of vision between the remote control and the receiver is free of obstacles to ensure the best reception. The remote control has one IR transmitter in the upper part with a range of up to 7 metres from the receiver at an angle of up to 30º in both directions.

If the remote control range becomes lower, and the field of vision between the remote control and the receiver is free of obstacles, maybe the batteries are empty. We recommend replacing the batteries.

*Battery installation.*

Remove the battery compartment cover in the remote control and slide two AA batteries into it. As shown in the following picture.

*Recomendaciones acerca de las baterías.*
*	Keep the batteries out of the reach of children. 
*	Do not try to recharge empty batteries. Do not expose to fire, disassemble or short circuit them. 
*	Change the batteries once a year for security reasons.
*	Change both batteries at the same time. Do not mix battery types.
*	Remove the batteries if you won't be using the remote control for an extended period.
*	Dispose of used batteries according to your local environmental laws and guidelines.
