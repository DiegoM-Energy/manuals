## Connection diagram

Caution: Check that the voltage in the power outlet is appropriate for the power adaptor of your Energy TDT SD3, that is 110 to 240 V. Disconnect the devices from the energy network before connecting it. Check the information given by the manufacturer of your TV if necessary.

Optionally, you can extend the antenna signal to another device, as a videorecorder, by connecting another antenna cable to your Energy SD3 Ant OUT connector.
