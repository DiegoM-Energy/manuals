In order to turn off the device, (Standby mode) hold the power button "STANDBY" (8). The device will enter the standby mode and the IR receiver light will turn red. In this mode, your TDT SD3 uses the "Eco Energy" technology that keeps the device in standby mode without battery consumption.

If you are not using the device for an extended period, we recommend to completely turn off the device, disconnecting it from the energy network.
