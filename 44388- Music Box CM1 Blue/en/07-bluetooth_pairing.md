## Bluetooth Pairing

Every time you turn on your *Energy Music Box CM1 Bluetooth*, pairing mode will start automatically; at the same time, the search and pairing process will start on your Bluetooth® device (smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc).  Once you have identified the *Energy Music Box CM1 Bluetooth* on your device, select connect. It will immediately connect without codes. The speaker will play a sound indicating that the connection has been established.

To pair the speaker with the last device again, you only need to turn on the *Energy Music Box CM1 Bluetooth* and the synchronization will start automatically.

If you want to pair another Bluetooth® device, you should press the FOLDER CHANGE (5) button. That way the current pairing will end and it will start searching for other Bluetooth® devices.
