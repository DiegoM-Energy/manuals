## Troubleshooting
* Is my new Energy luetooth Keyboard designed to be compatible with all of the devices?

Yes, it is. The only requirement is that the device should be Bluetooth ready. Otherwise, it is necessary to acquire a Bluetooth receiver which is sold separately.

* The keyboard and my device have been paired rightly, but the symbols printed on the keyboard donâ€™t match with the ones shown on the device.

It is possible that your keyboard has not been configured to use Spanish language. Please confirm that your devices are configured selecting Spanish language (it is not necessary to change the OSD language).

* Special characters such as accents and umlauts are not displayed correctly.

When work under Android systems, the way to introduce the special characters is the same as that used for virtual keyboard of touchscreens. You should long-press the key of the letter on which you want to use the accent or umlaut and a list of different options will be shown in the screen. Press the number of your option and the special characters should be shown correctly.
