## <quick_guide> Battery Management/First use

Your Energy Bluetooth Keyboard Neo 10 has a rechargeable lithium ion battery. Initially the battery is charged at the factory, but it is highly recommended that you perform a full charge before the first use.
Recharge the battery by connecting the device to a USB Port using the MicroUSB-USB cable included with the product. The normal charging time is lower than 1 hour. In order to keep the battery in good condition, we recommend that you turn it off while charging and not leave it charging more than 2 hours.
