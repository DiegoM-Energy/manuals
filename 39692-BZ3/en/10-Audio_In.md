## Line-in

It is also possible to enjoy your *Energy Music Box BZ3 Bluetooth* without pairing it with any bluetooth device thanks to its Audio-In connection (14) in which you can connect an audio cable with a 3.5mm jack connector and the other end to your player.

Your *Energy Music Box BZ3 Bluetooth* must be turned on in order to use this function.

**NOTE:** While using the device in Audio-In mode, it is not possible to control the playback neither the volume from the speaker. You have to do it from the player connected.
