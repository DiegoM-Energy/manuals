## Updating

Your Energy Phone has an operating system based on Android#trade# which you can reinstall or update if necessary. Updates will be made via OTA (Over-The-Air) by default, so your Energy Phone will automatically connect to our servers, download the file and install the new software as soon as it is released. 

You can also update your Energy Phone using your PC. The process is simple but has to be done carefully and only when it is really necessary. If you notice that the device crashes, restarts unexpectedly or you have problems accessing the content of the internal storage memory, you should reinstall or update the operating system to a newer compatible version if available.

Follow these steps to install:

1. Make sure that the battery of your Energy Phone is fully charged. Otherwise, plug your Energy Tablet to the external power using the provided AC/DC power adapter and wait until the battery is fully charged.

2. Access the www.energysistem.com website from your computer.

3. Enter the "Support" section and choose the type of product "Smartphone".

4. Choose your Energy Phone model from the dropdown list that appears and then download the latest Android#trade# operating system version available.
**Important:** 
Make sure that the operating system version you are downloading is specific for your model and serial number, otherwise you could damage the device.

5. Unzip the file on your computer.

6. Open the text file included with the download and follow the instructions to install the new operating system on your Energy Phone.
