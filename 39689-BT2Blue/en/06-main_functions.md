### Turn on / off your device

To turn on and off your device use the multifunction button (1).

Press that button for about 3 seconds to turn on the  device. The  LED placed behind that button will start flashing. In case your headphones were already paired with another bluetooth device, they will try to connect to it. If the connection fails, they will enter pairing mode.

To turn off your device, press the multifunction button (1) again for about 5 seconds.

### Charging the battery

When there are about 15 minutes left, the headphones will emit a beep sound to warn you. This sound will repeat every minute until the battery runs out.

**Note:** It is recommended to turn off the device when charging. Do not store or leave unused for a long period of time with the battery completely discharged.
