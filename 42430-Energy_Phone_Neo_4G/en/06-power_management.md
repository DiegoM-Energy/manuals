## <quick_guide> Power/First use

* Your Energy Phone has a built-in rechargeable lithium ion battery. Recharge the battery by connecting the device to the outlet only using the AC/DC 5V included with the product. The charging time ranges from 2-4 hours, depending on whether the device is off or running. In order to keep the battery in good condition, we recommend that you turn it off while charging and not leave it charging more than 8 hours.
* You have several ways to improve the performance and optimize the battery use of your Energy Phone:
Set your Smartphone to automatically turn off the display after a few seconds of inactivity in Settings > Display > Sleep after.
Select an ideal display brightness in Settings > Display > Brightness.
Turn on the Wi-Fi connnection whenever you can since it needs less battery than 3G/4G connection and you will save in your data connection.
