## <quick_guide> Switching on and off

Before turning on your Energy Phone, make sure that the microSIM cards are inserted in their slots. After that, press the power button (10) located on the upper right of your device for a few seconds. When the operating system has loaded, unlock the device to start using it. Enter the PIN number of your microSIM cards and then drag the padlock outside the circle using your finger.
In order to turn off the device, hold the power button (10) until you see the power off menu, then select OK.
Briefly pressing the power button (10) locks/unlocks the device, turning the screen on/off and activating the power saving mode.
