## 4. CONNECTIONS

Caution: Make sure to check that the voltage of the wall outlet has the same rating than the receiver.
To prevent the risk of electric shock, do not open the cover or the back of the receiver.
When connecting the receiver to other equipment (e.g. TV, VCR and amplifier) make sure to refer to relevant user manual for instruction. Also, make sure you disconnect all the equipments from the mains supply before the connection.
