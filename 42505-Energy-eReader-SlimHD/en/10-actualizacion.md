## Update

You can update your Energy eReader using your computer. The procedure is simple but must be done carefully and only if necessary.

Follow these steps to proceed with the update:
-	Make sure your Energy eReader's battery is fully charged. Otherwise, connect your Energy eReader to an external power supply using a USB charger (5V / 1Ah max.) or to your computer via USB and wait until the battery is fully charged.
-	Visit www.energysistem.com using your computer.
- Go to the "support" section and select "eReader".
- Choose your Energy eReader model from the drop-down list and download the latest firmware version.
-	Unzip the file on your computer.
-	Open the included text file and follow the instructions to install the new operating system on your Energy eReader.

### Important: Make sure the version you are downloading is specific to your eReader model and serial number. Otherwise it could damage the device.
