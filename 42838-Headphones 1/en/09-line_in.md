## Audio input

In addition to all modes explained so far, you can also connect your *Energy Headphones 1 Bluetooth* to your music player through the included audio cable if you run out of battery or simply do not want to use the wireless connection.

Turn off your *Energy Headphones 1 Bluetooth* and connect your cable to the AUDIO-IN (7) to use this mode.

**NOTE:** Playback control function is not supported in this mode. Therefore, you will have to use the player connected to your headphones to turn up and down the volume, switch to another song or pause playback.
