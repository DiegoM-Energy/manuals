### Charging the battery

When the speaker stop emit sound or the battery icon start blinking, is the time to charge it. Connect the mini USB end of the included USB cable to your *Energy Music Box BZ3 Bluetooth* (11) and the other end to any USB port that can provide energy (PC, USB wall charger, car, etc).

In case the charging process is not carried out with the device off or if it is carried out using a source providing less than 1A, the LED indicator will not turn off but it will reduce its intensity.
