## Bluetooth pairing and FM transmission

### Bluetooth pairing
Every time you turn on your *Energy Car FM-T Bluetooth*, pairing mode will start automatically; at the same time, the search and pairing process will start on your Bluetooth® device (smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc).  Once you have identified the *Energy Car FM-T Bluetooth* on your device, select connect. It will intermediately connect without codes.
To synch again with the last device it has been paired, just turn the *Energy Car FM-T Bluetooth* on and it will automatically synch.
If you want to synch another Bluetooth® device, you should finish the connection in the settings of the transmitting device. That way the current pairing will end and it will start searching for other Bluetooth® devices.

### FM Transmitter
Your *Energy Car FM-T Bluetooth* features an integrated FM transmitter that allows to send the music 
played in your Bluetooth portable device previously pairing the receiver to the FM radio in your car. To ensure a proper reception of the signal, both the transmitter and the receiver must be set in the same frequency.
First, search a free frequency with the radio in your car. You will be able to easy detect a free frequency as
they are those with no signal or a poor quality signal. When
you find a free radio signal, select the same frequency in your *Energy Car FM-T Bluetooth*. This can be done by pressing the FREQUENCY CONTROL button and changing the frequency with the DIAL.  Once the desired frequency set, press again the FREQUENCY CONTROL button to confirm the setting.
At this point you should receive the transmitted signal in the car radio. If the quality is not good enough, select another free frequency.  We recommend to select frequencies between 100.0 Hz and 108.0 Hz.
