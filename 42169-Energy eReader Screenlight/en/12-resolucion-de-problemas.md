## Troubleshooting

**Is it possible to turn off the eReader without having an image on its screen?**

The eReader will always have an image on its screen, but do not worry as it will not consume your eReaders battery. In addition to that, you can set another image to be displayed on the shut down screen.

**I cannot change the font type of a pdf file**

The pdf file is shown as created, with its own font types and sizes. Therefore you will not be able to commit any changes. This is the limitation you will have with this file format. However, you will be able to zoom in/out and browse through the book as if it was another format.

**I cannot open an eBook**

Check that your eReaders supports the eBook format.

**The eReader is locked and does not respond.**

Try pressing the reset button using a very thin object such as a paper clip. Then press the ON button. 

**The eReader does not show correctly the eBook characters, the space lining, etc.**

This is due to the format the file has been digitalized in. Many eBooks are digitalized and formatted automatically without being reviewed. Use only reliable and quality content providers for the best reading experience.
